🌱 NDVI Land Cover Classification | Kaggle Hackathon
Logistic Regression model to classify land cover types (forest, farm, water, etc.) from satellite-derived NDVI time-series data.

🔍 Overview
This project tackles the Summer Analytics First Hackathon challenge by building a robust Logistic Regression classifier to predict land cover categories using noisy NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) signals. The solution includes:

Temporal feature engineering (seasonal averages, rolling statistics)

Data denoising (interpolation, Savitzky-Golay filtering)

Structured pipelines (scikit-learn Pipeline for preprocessing + modeling)


🛠️ Tech Stack


Python 3 + scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

Kaggle (for data/competition submission)
